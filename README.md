# Supreme Scraper 2019 (Hafal)
## Description
This is a bot that will purchase various Supreme goods primarily through Selenium. The bot can be activated at specific times to ensure that your bad human reflexes do not come in the way of a drop. Due to a lack of preferential treatment from the Supreme company, it is not assigned to work according to pre set URL's that will dictate the location of the sought after item. Instead, some personal research is required to find out keywords regarding the item you wish to purchase. These keywords can genereally be found through the announcements of items that will be dropped in the future, using the name of the item is usually efficient enough. Through a simple regex query, it will search for your input keyword and perform the required actions to purchase the item within seconds. In order to fulfill the purchase however, one must be present. The bot is not set to complete captchas, however when one has gotten this far with the items in the cart, there won't be any issues completing your purchase.

## Description update 2020
Due to the lack of interest in this horrible hypebeast brand, I do not perform any updates to the application and I do not know whether it works anymore. I severely doubt it however. I'm certain the code code be updated and revamped to ensure functionality, however my interest is no longer there.
